> Disc Golf score keeping app built with the VueJS framework


## Work in progress

This project is a work in progress with the goal to develop a basic single page web application as a learning tool for JavaScript frameworks.

It's my intention to build the same design using the React framework and AngularJS.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
